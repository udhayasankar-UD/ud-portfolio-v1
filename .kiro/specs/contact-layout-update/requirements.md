# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the contact section layout to improve the visual balance and user experience. The current contact section has a centered form, but we want to create a two-column layout with engaging text on the left side and the contact form on the right side.

2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the left text SHALL take up approximately half of the available width
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the text SHALL appear above the form in a stacked layout

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contact section loads THEN the system SHALL display the contact form on the right side
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the form SHALL take up approximately half of the available width
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the form SHALL appear below the text in a stacked layout

### Requirement 3
