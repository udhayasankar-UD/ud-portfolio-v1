# Design Document

## Overview

The contact section layout update will transform the current centered form layout into a balanced two-column design. The left column will feature engaging text that encourages user interaction, while the right column will contain the existing contact form. This design maintains the current visual styling while improving the overall user experience and visual hierarchy.

## Architecture

The ContactSection component will be updated to use a flex-based two-column layout:

- **Left Column**: Contains the engaging text with appropriate typography and styling
- **Right Column**: Contains the existing contact form with all current functionality
- **Responsive Behavior**: Columns stack vertically on mobile devices

## Components and Interfaces

### ContactSection Component Updates

The main ContactSection component will be modified to include:

1. **Left Text Section**:
   - Primary heading: "Want to start a new project?"
   - Secondary text: "or just say hello"
   - Styled with existing gradient text classes for consistency
   - Proper spacing and typography hierarchy

2. **Right Form Section**:
   - Existing form structure maintained
   - All current form validation and submission logic preserved
   - Success message display remains unchanged

3. **Layout Container**:
   - Flex container with responsive breakpoints
   - Equal width distribution on desktop (50/50 split)
   - Stacked layout on mobile devices
   - Consistent gap spacing between columns

## Data Models

No new data models are required. The existing form state management will remain unchanged:

```typescript
const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);
```

## Error Handling

The existing error handling and form validation will be preserved:
- Form validation for required fields
- Email format validation
- Submission state management

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Testing
- Verify two-column layout on desktop screens (lg breakpoint and above)
- Verify stacked layout on mobile screens (below lg breakpoint)
- Confirm text styling matches existing design system
- Validate form positioning and spacing

### Functional Testing
- Ensure form submission continues to work correctly
- Verify success message displays properly in the right column
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Confirm accessibility is maintained

### Responsive Testing
- Test layout at various breakpoints:
  - Mobile: < 1024px (stacked layout)
  - Desktop: â‰¥ 1024px (side-by-side layout)
- Verify smooth transitions between layouts
- Check spacing and alignment at all screen sizes

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing Tailwind CSS classes for consistency
- Maintain current color scheme and styling
- Preserve existing animations and transitions
- Keep the same section background and spacing
- Ensure the layout integrates seamlessly with the rest of the page
